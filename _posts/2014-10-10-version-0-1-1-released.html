<h1>Batch Calculator v0.1.1</h1>

<p class="lead" >Batch calculator allows you to:
<ul class="lead">
    <li> Switched completely to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/objectlistview/files/objectlistview-python/v1.2/">ObjectListView</a>
    for all the list-type display widgets, in the main window as well as in all
    the relevant dialogs. As a consequence all the dependencies on ListCtrl's
    mixins were dropped.</li>
    <li> Added a function to calculate the zeolite composition (molar ratios) from the
    masses of the reactants.</li>
    <li> Reduced the number of lists displayed in the main window, now there are two
    panels, input and output, and each has two lists.</li>
    <li> Added binaries for Windows and Mac OSX for easier installation. </li>
    <li> Small adjustments to the database. </li>
</ul>
