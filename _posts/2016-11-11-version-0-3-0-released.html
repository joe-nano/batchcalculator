            <p class="lead" >New features:
            <ul class="lead">
                <li> New internal methods for adding/editing/deleting database entries
                 (no external software required anymore!). </li>
                <li> Option to create an new database from scratch. </li>
                <li> New option to generate pdf reports directly (TeX is still an option but
                    if you don't like it now there is an alternative). </li>
                <li> pdf reports can be generated not only from batch calculation (moles to masses) but also
                  from the composition calculation (masses to moles).</li>
                <li> Program can now handle chemicals that are multicomponent mixtures. </li>
            </ul></p>
            <h3> Other improvements </h3>
            <p class="lead">
            <ul class="lead">
                <li>  Volumes are now included next to masses in the results panel (for chemicals that are liquids
                      and have their densities in the database). </li>
                <li> Additional scaling of the results is now possible. </li>
                <li> Several annoying bugs were corrected. </li>
