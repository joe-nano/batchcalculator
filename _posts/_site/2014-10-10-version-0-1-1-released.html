                <li> Switched completely to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/objectlistview/files/objectlistview-python/v1.2/">ObjectListView</a>
                for all the list-type display widgets, in the main window as well as in all
                the relevant dialogs. As a consequence all the dependencies on ListCtrl's
                mixins were dropped.</li>
                <li> Added a function to calculate the zeolite composition (molar ratios) from the
                masses of the reactants.</li>
                <li> Reduced the number of lists displayed in the main window, now there are two
                panels, input and output, and each has two lists.</li>
                <li> Added binaries for Windows and Mac OSX for easier installation. </li>
                <li> Small adjustments to the database. </li>
