TODO
=====

* use ``appdirs`` package to place the user config file in the right path
* write a django app to expose the calculator functionality through a
  web form
* add an option to select a tex template in the export tex dialog
* add an option to export to HTML, and plain text
* add an option to calculate the pH of the batch (this onw is tricky since
  first the equilibrium concentrations of all the species in the solution need
  to be calculated) CAN BE DONE with 'ionize' package, https://github.com/lewisamarshall/ionize
* rewrite the basic classes used in the calculator so that the interface and
  manipulation become simpler
* add consistency check to the database:
    - check for duplicate entries in chemicals, components, and batch,
    - check if all the components have sources,
    - check if all the chemicals are sources for existing components
* add a hash generator to get a hash based on the calculation input and results
* use the hash unique for the report to generate a QR code and put it one the
  report and optionally print the qr codes on the stickers for samples
* add an option to save the current database

DONE
====

* reduce the number of lists in the input panel to 2 instead of 4, leave only
  components and reactants,
* switch to ObjectListView instead of ListCtrl for lists in the input and
  output panels,
* add an option to calculate the molar ratios of the components based on the
  masses of the reactants (for reconstructing the values from old papers)
* make a default to select all reactants for scaling to sample
* add options (either from the edit dialog or a new menu in the menu bar) to
  extend (add/remove/modify) entries in the database from the GUI
* add a button to rescale to the mass of one on the reactants
* add an option to print volumes instead of masses for liquids
* add an option to generate pdf reports using reportlab, both for batch
  calculation and composition calculation
* add an option to create new database from scratch
* add an option to print a report form the inverse calculation,
  masses -> molar ratios
